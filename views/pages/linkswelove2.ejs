<p>Heading into the Victoria Day long weekend we’ve gathered some links we love and other tidbits of news from the past few weeks for some light lounge chair reading.
<br><br>
Fun fact: During her reign, Queen Victoria acquired 2 pieces of real estate: Balmoral Castle (purchased for her by Prince Albert) and Osborne House (their summer retreat).

<br>
<h3>Balmoral Castle</h3>

<p class="bloglist">We recently came across this interesting infographic on Visually. Although it pertains to U.S. commercial investors (most of our contact with the IRS comes from <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i> and <i>The Big Short</i>), many of the considerations still apply to Canadian investors. Do you agree with this infographic? How do you go about assessing the profitability of a commercial property?</p>
