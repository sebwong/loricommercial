<p>Heading into the Victoria Day long weekend we’ve gathered some links we love and other tidbits of news from the past few weeks for some light lounge chair reading. Since the weekend is extra long we've added some extra love (&amp; learnings) for you to peruse. Have a great long weekend!
<br><br>
Fun fact: During her reign, Queen Victoria acquired 2 pieces of real estate: Balmoral Castle (purchased for her by Prince Albert) and Osborne House (their summer retreat).
</p>
<br>
<h3>Balmoral Castle</h3>
<br>

<br><br>
<p>Still in use by the royal family today, the sale for Balmoral castle was completed in June 1852 with a price tag of £32 000, equivalent to £4,099,555.56 today.</p>
<br>
<h3>Osborne House</h3>
<br>

<br>
<p>The royal couple initially leased Osborne House and then bought it for £28,000 in May 1845 (approximately £3,124,258.06 today).</p>

<img class="blogimg" src="images/edgecomputing.jpg" alt="Why Edge Computing? Because Closer to Market is Better">
<center><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C4lZCyNUkAAD1od.jpg" class="source-text">Source</a></center>
<p class="bloglist">A new white paper commissioned by CrossLayer, a managed network services company, explores the potential for edge computing in commercial real estate projects. For those who aren’t familiar with the details of edge computing (us included) the infographic above breaks down the benefits of edge vs traditional computing. Our main takeaway? Introducing edge computing=loading that YouTube video of puppies faster than your friend in another building. And as a building owner, this could pad your sales pitch and ultimately your bottom line.

	<p class="bloglist">Remember what happens when there’s decreased supply but increased demand? Avison Young’s Q1 Report marked a record year in sales, almost $12 billion in CRE investment for 2016. However, investor interest continues to grow but there continues to be an ongoing lack of available product.

<br>
	<p class="bloglist">As rent prices rise, restaurateurs who invest in some of the city’s most depressed neighbourhoods are being edged out by the uncontrolled cost of commercial real estate. Restaurants like Starving Artist and Arvo have closed or moved due to exponentially rising lease rates. Meanwhile restaurants like Foxley in the Ossington area have only managed to cling to their block if they’re one of the lucky few who have negotiated longer leases. To put it in perspective the rent for Fidel Gastro’s on Queen West has gone from $7 000 to $11 000 in 4 years. Owning a small 50 seat restaurant would cost $57,000 a year, or $4,750 a month. Is it time to start putting out tip jars for restaurant owners? “Save Our Space: Tip the Place”.

<p class="bloglist">Ottawa’s tech sector is rapidly growing causing investors to plan for more commercial development in the region to accommodate the growth. However, the vacancy rates are still high, most likely due to the types of building available; think of the building where you go to get your passport versus the famous Google slide. If building owners modernize and upgrade older office buildings, Ottawa could see large growth in 2017 with CBRE Ottawa’s national investment team Nico Zentil expecting $1.4 billion in transactions.
